*Analysis of projected changes in the number of days with temperatures over X degrees, for IDP sites, illustrating how climate change is exacerbating fire risk.*

*Explain the components of the fire weather index, show how they link to climate change forcast models for temperature and precipitation. A quantifiable FWI would require a full academic study, but the below charts and data from the [World Bank](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/nigeria/climate-data-projections) we can start to show the connections, for some example countries*
